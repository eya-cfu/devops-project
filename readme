This is a project for DevOps class.

We create a SpringBoot basic program with 6 ORM entities and deploy it through a Jenkins Pipeline.

The pipline fetches the source code from this github repository, compiles and package it with maven. Unit tests are run with JUnit. We also run a SonarQube quality analysis. We finally deploy the jar file to Nexus.
